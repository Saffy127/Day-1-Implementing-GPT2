# Implementing GPT2 via Huggingface Inference API

## Course Introduction
  This course is designed for **developers looking to start building foundational skills in Natural Language Processing.**
  
  **We are going to introduce transformers**, what they are, and how to use them to do things like text generation and summarization. We'll start with implementing GPT2 which is free and open source before getting into newer state-of-the-art models GPT3 and Flan-T5. (ChatGPT is a modified version of GPT3!) 
  
  **We're going to be implementing a few models** because it's important to understand that there are different options. These models have their own pros / cons and unique parameters but share a common architecture. As progress continues to be made there are going to be many new models released. 
  
  **Being comfortable reading documentation and published papers is so much more important than just knowing how to implement a specific model.** That way when new models come out we will know how to integrate them into our existing workflow and be able to understand what new capabilities they have. Recognizing and applying net-new capabilities is a huge area of opportunity.
