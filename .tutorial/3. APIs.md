# APIs

An API is a way for two or more computer programs to communicate with each other programmatically (with code). That is really powerful because we can employ API's to automate tasks that would take much longer to perform ourselves. Here is a quick [video explanation on how API's work if you'd like a refresher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY).

For this course, we are going to implement GPT2 by leveraging the [HuggingFace Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api). **HuggingFace is a community and data science platform that provides tools for building, training, and deploying machine learning models.**

The model file for GPT2-Large is over 3GB, currently too large to fit in our Repl (and many other devices) but this API lets us send requests to the model hosted on HuggingFace's servers.  

**_In order to be able to access the HuggingFace API, you will have to create an account and access your own API token. Run through the following steps to set up your account..._**

###  Creating a HuggingFace Account and Retrieving Your API Token
1. Go to the HuggingFace website https://huggingface.co/ and create an account
2. After you have created an account, navigate to settings and click on access tokens
3. Click new token and give the name "gpt2" and set role to "read"
4. A new api key will appear. It is important that you save this key. You will need easy access to it in the next step! Do so by saving it as a variable in main.py.
