* Transformers - what they are and how they work

## Lesson Objectives
In today's lesson, we will learn how to make a simple call to a GPT2 model using Huggingface's inference API and how we can tweak the model. This will be a good foundation to build on and start to develop our intuition. 


# Where to Find the Good Stuff
All the files you need for your app can be found in the "Files" tab, on the left side of the screen in the sidebar. We will also link to relevant sources throughout, we encourage you to keep these links open and come back to explore them further if they interest you! Getting comfortable with searching through docs, whitepapers, example code, and then integrating ideas from them into your own work can really improve your capabilities as a developer.
