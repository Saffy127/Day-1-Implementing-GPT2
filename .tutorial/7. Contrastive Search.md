## Contrastive Search

Contrastive search is the newest discovery. It picks the word that has the highest probability of appearing but is least like the words in the prefix text. By doing this, this method ensures that the model produces text that is not repetitive and is grammatically correct and coherent.

**Try implementing and testing contrastive search:**
```python
contrastive_params = {"max_length": 128, "penalty_alpha": 0.6, "top_k": 4}
```

As the contrastive search output is exceptionally high quality, we may want to use this for many tasks going forward but not always. 

Changing these parameters is referred to as *hyperparameter optimization* and is its own field within machine learning. 

Never be afraid to look at how these tools work under the hood, especially now that you have experience. When you are blazing your own trail that is when the real learning happens.
